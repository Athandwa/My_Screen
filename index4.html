            <h2>Seatbelts and Child Restraints</h2>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wearing a seatbelt can be a life or death decision both for you and your passengers, even if you are only travelling a few kilometres because most road crashes happen close to home.</li>
                <li>Wearing a seatbelt when travelling at 40 kilometres is just as important as wearing a seatbelt at faster speeds. Crash impact at 40km/h is like falling from a two storey building onto concrete.</li>
                <li>Passengers not wearing seatbelts can kill or seriously injure others in the car if, for example, the driver has to brake suddenly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Child Restrains</h3>
            <h2>Seatbelt laws</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Drivers must ensure that they and any passengers in the vehicle are wearing a seatbelt or approved child restraint. Penalties include demerit points and fines.</li>
                <li>Passengers aged 16 years or older also commit an offence if they do not wear a seatbelt when one is available.</li>
                <li>Seatbelts do not have to be worn if you are carrying a letter from your doctor have a stating that you do not have to wear a seatbelt on the ground of physical disability or any medical ground. The letter must be carried with you whenever
                    travelling in a vehicle, or a seatbelt must be worn.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This will protect you and your unborn baby in the event of a crash. No matter what stage of your pregnancy, it is vital that you always wear a seatbelt.
                </li>
                <li>Wear your seatbelt comfortably and correctly with the lap part of your seatbelt worn as low as possible, positioned below your baby.
                  It should be over the upper thighs and across the pelvis. The sash part of your seatbelt should pass above
                  the stomach and across the centre of your chest.</li>
