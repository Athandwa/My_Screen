            <h3>If your vehicle breaks down</h3>
            <p>If your vehicle breaks down and you require roadside assistance, there are steps you can take to keep yourself safe and minimise the risk for others:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be vigilant, it is often difficult for other vehicles to stop in a hurry so assess the area for risks and hazards.</li>
                <li>Find a safe spot to pull over. Park the car as far left as possible.</li>
                <li>Make sure you can be seen. Turn on your hazard lights. Turn on your parking lights in poor light, or raise your bonnet.</li>
                <li>If it's safe to leave the car, try to exit from the left passenger side. Move to the far left of the road, away from your car and behind a safety barrier if possible while waiting for help.</li>
                <li>If you need to change a flat tyre or check under the bonnet of your car, remain aware of other cars driving past. If it's not safe, call for roadside assistance.</li>
                <li>Use of portable warning triangles in vehicles over 12 tonnes. If the triangles are not properly placed, the driver could face prosecution and would be held liable for any crash that results from a failure to comply with these requirements.</li>
            </ul>
