          <h3>Vehicle Fitness and Driving in Bad Weather</h3>
          <p>The safe driver will be well aware of the need to have a vehicle best equipped to drive safely
             in bad weather and not break down!</p>
          <p>We would advise a complete pre-trip inspection with a focus on the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do a visual, hands-on inspection and check all important items, including tyres, wiper blades, fluid and lights.</li>
            <li>Check that wiper blades are not worn and are capable of clearing the windscreen correctly.</li>
            <li>When it's your safety, your family's safety, and the
              safety of others on the line the cost to purchase a decent set of windshield wipers is a small price to pay.</li>
            <li>Donâ€™t forget to check the spare tyre.</li>
            <li>Tyre tread is very important especially on
              slippery roads allowing you to slow down and stop suddenly should the need arise.</li>
            <li>Guard against <mark>over</mark> and <mark>under</mark> inflated tyres and potential loss in traction.</li>
            <li>Check the battery, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid and headlights.</li>
            <li>Ensure that lights are clean and number plates are clearly visible and legible.</li>
            <li>Check that mirrors are clear and the windows are demisted thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Listen and obey national
              and local radio/TV announcements and warnings regarding road and weather conditions for your journey.</li>
            <li>Look out for signs warning of adverse conditions
               including fixed signs, such as those warning of exposure to high-winds.</li>
          </ul>
