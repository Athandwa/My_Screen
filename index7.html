      <h3>Road Safety for drivers/motorists at construction zones/ road works</h3>
      <p>Before embarking on the road to the
        construction zone it is advised to schedule enough time to drive safely and
        to check the radio or internet websites for traffic information.
        Expect delays and leave early so you can reach your destination on time.</p>
      <p>Safety professionals recommend several precautions to help make construction zones safer for everyone:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When approaching a construction/maintenance situation exercise caution and slow down. </li>
        <li>Observe warning and caution signs before entering a construction zone. </li>
        <li>Observe these posted signs until you see the one that says you've left the work zone.</li>
        <li>Turn on your lights to make your vehicle more visible.</li>
        <li>Expecting the unexpected is a golden rule when travelling through construction zones.</li>
        <li>Always be aware that vehicles ahead of you may stop unexpectedly. </li>
        <li>Stay alert for aggressive drivers. If another motorist is aggressively jockeying for position,
          drivers should let them move on. Challenging another
          driver encourages road rage and endangers the safety0 of other motorists and workers in the area.</li>
          <li>Avoid distracting activities. Remaining alert for unexpected hazards is
            critical when travelling through construction zones. </li>
          <li>Watch for construction equipment and workers. Construction equipment entering and exiting a work zone without warning, equipment
            extending into traffic, and construction crews and flaggers
            working dangerously close to moving traffic are a few of the hazards to expect.</li>
          <li>Be patient, cautious, and courteous. Remember, the work zone crew
            members are working to improve the road and make your future drive better.</li>
      </ul>
