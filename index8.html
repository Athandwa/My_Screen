            <h3>Speed Limits and the Lawspeeds</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>60 km/h on a public road within an urban area</li>
              <li>100 km/h on public road outside an urban area which is not a freeway; and</li>
              <li>120 km/h on every freeway.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A maximum speed limit of 80 km/h for a goods vehicle with a GVM exceeding 9t, a combination vehicle consisting of a goods vehicle
              (i.e. drawing vehicle and one or two trailers) of which the sum of the
               GVM of the goods vehicle and of the trailer(s) exceeds 9t
               and an articulated vehicle of which the GCM exceeds 9t.</p>
               <p>Provision is also made that certain vehicles (minibuses, buses and goods vehicles) shall not exceed the speed limits
                 imposed on tyres by SABS 1550 or as approved by the manufacturer of such tyres.</p>
               <p>Certain tractors and trailers or combination vehicles may also
                 not exceed speed limits of 35 km/h and 15 km/h based on their braking capabilities.</p>
               <p>Road traffic signs can also prescribe speed limits
                 which may be lower or higher than the general limits applicable on a public road.</p>
