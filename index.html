                <h1>Overtaking Rules</h1>
            </header>
            <!-- <article> -->
                <p>Overtaking other vehicles can be dangerous. The difficulty with overtaking is judging the space required to complete the manoeuvre safely.</p>
                <p>You must overtake on the right unless a vehicle is waiting to turn right, is stationary, or if you and the other vehicle are travelling in marked lanes. In these instances you may overtake on the left side if it is safe.</p>
                <h3>When overtaking you must:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not go over the speed limit</li>
                    <li>Make sure the road ahead is clear and that there is sufficient space for you to complete the manoeuvre (check side streets and other lanes to ensure nothing will enter this space while you are overtaking)</li>
                    <li>Check mirrors</li>
                    <li>Signal each change in position long enough to give sufficient warning to others</li>
                    <li>Check blind spots for motorcycles and other vehicles before changing your lane position</li>
                    <li>Pass the vehicle with sufficient space to avoid a collision (you should be able to see the vehicle you have overtaken in your rear vision mirror before you move in front of it)</li>
                    <li>Give way to traffic already in the lane you are moving to.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>You must not overtake:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unless you have a clear view of any approaching traffic and you can complete the manoeuvre safely (do not commence an overtaking manoeuvre when approaching a crest, curve or any limited vision situation)</li>
                    <li>Another vehicle that is stopping or has stopped at a pedestrian crossing, intersection or railway crossing</li>
                    <li>Across an unbroken (continuous) line, unless the line closest to you is broken</li>
                    <li>Where a road narrows.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>If your vehicle breaks down</h3>
            <p>If your vehicle breaks down and you require roadside assistance, there are steps you can take to keep yourself safe and minimise the risk for others:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be vigilant, it is often difficult for other vehicles to stop in a hurry so assess the area for risks and hazards.</li>
                <li>Find a safe spot to pull over. Park the car as far left as possible.</li>
                <li>Make sure you can be seen. Turn on your hazard lights. Turn on your parking lights in poor light, or raise your bonnet.</li>
                <li>If it's safe to leave the car, try to exit from the left passenger side. Move to the far left of the road, away from your car and behind a safety barrier if possible while waiting for help.</li>
                <li>If you need to change a flat tyre or check under the bonnet of your car, remain aware of other cars driving past. If it's not safe, call for roadside assistance.</li>
                <li>Use of portable warning triangles in vehicles over 12 tonnes. If the triangles are not properly placed, the driver could face prosecution and would be held liable for any crash that results from a failure to comply with these requirements.</li>

            <h1>Seatbelt</h1>
        </header>
        <article>
            <h2>Seatbelts and Child Restraints</h2>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wearing a seatbelt can be a life or death decision both for you and your passengers, even if you are only travelling a few kilometres because most road crashes happen close to home.</li>
                <li>Wearing a seatbelt when travelling at 40 kilometres is just as important as wearing a seatbelt at faster speeds. Crash impact at 40km/h is like falling from a two storey building onto concrete.</li>
                <li>Passengers not wearing seatbelts can kill or seriously injure others in the car if, for example, the driver has to brake suddenly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Child Restrains</h3>
            <h2>Seatbelt laws</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Drivers must ensure that they and any passengers in the vehicle are wearing a seatbelt or approved child restraint. Penalties include demerit points and fines.</li>
                <li>Passengers aged 16 years or older also commit an offence if they do not wear a seatbelt when one is available.</li>
                <li>Seatbelts do not have to be worn if you are carrying a letter from your doctor have a stating that you do not have to wear a seatbelt on the ground of physical disability or any medical ground. The letter must be carried with you whenever
                    travelling in a vehicle, or a seatbelt must be worn.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This will protect you and your unborn baby in the event of a crash. No matter what stage of your pregnancy, it is vital that you always wear a seatbelt.
                </li>
                <li>Wear your seatbelt comfortably and correctly with the lap part of your seatbelt worn as low as possible, positioned below your baby.
                  It should be over the upper thighs and across the pelvis. The sash part of your seatbelt should pass above
                  the stomach and across the centre of your chest.</li>

        <h1>Traffic Lights Rules</h1>
      </header>
      <article>
          <h2>Traffic lights</h2>
          <img src="images/traffic-light-green.jpg" alt="">
          Green means proceed through the intersection carefully.<br>
          <img src="images/traffic-light-yellow.jpg" alt="">
          Yellow (amber) means stop. You can enter the intersection if you are so close that sudden braking might cause a crash.<br>
          <img src="images/traffic-light-red.jpg" alt="">
          Do not go through the intersection.<br>
          <h3>Turning arrows at traffic lights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Some traffic lights have arrows to control traffic turning right or left.</li>
            <li>A green arrow means you can only turn in that direction.</li>
            <li>A red arrow means traffic waiting to turn must wait behind the stop
              line until the arrow turns green or disappears, even if there is no traffic on the road.</li>
          </ul>
          <img src="images/turning-arrow-light1.jpg" alt="">
          You must not go straight ahead or turn left. You may turn right.<br>
          <img src="images/turning-arrow-light1.jpg" alt="">
          You must not turn right but you can go straight ahead or turn left if the way is clear.<br>
          <img src="images/turning-arrow-light1.jpg" alt="">
          When the yellow (amber) arrow is flashing, you may proceed but you must give way
          to any pedestrian who is crossing the road into which you are turning.<br>

      <h3>Vehicle Fitness and Driving in Bad Weather</h3>
      <p>The safe driver will be well aware of the need to have a vehicle best equipped to drive safely
         in bad weather and not break down!</p>
      <p>We would advise a complete pre-trip inspection with a focus on the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do a visual, hands-on inspection and check all important items, including tyres, wiper blades, fluid and lights.</li>
        <li>Check that wiper blades are not worn and are capable of clearing the windscreen correctly.</li>
        <li>When it's your safety, your family's safety, and the
          safety of others on the line the cost to purchase a decent set of windshield wipers is a small price to pay.</li>
        <li>Don’t forget to check the spare tyre.</li>
        <li>Tyre tread is very important especially on
          slippery roads allowing you to slow down and stop suddenly should the need arise.</li>
        <li>Guard against <mark>over</mark> and <mark>under</mark> inflated tyres and potential loss in traction.</li>
        <li>Check the battery, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid and headlights.</li>
        <li>Ensure that lights are clean and number plates are clearly visible and legible.</li>
        <li>Check that mirrors are clear and the windows are demisted thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Listen and obey national
          and local radio/TV announcements and warnings regarding road and weather conditions for your journey.</li>
        <li>Look out for signs warning of adverse conditions
           including fixed signs, such as those warning of exposure to high-winds.</li>
