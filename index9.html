          <h2>Duties of Pedestrians When Crossing The Roads</h2>
          <p>Pedestrian crossings allow people to cross the road safely. These crossings are usually marked by white stripes on the road and are also known as zebra crossings.
            Some pedestrian crossings have zig zag lines marked on the road before the crossing.
            Take extra care when you see a zig zag line on the road as this means you are approaching a crossing
            which you may not be able to see because of a curve, crest or dip in the road.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Whenever a sidewalk or footpath abuts on the roadway of a public road,
               a pedestrian shall not walk on such roadway except for the
              purpose of crossing from one side of such roadway to the other or for
              some other sufficient reason.</li>
            <li>A pedestrian on a public road which has no sidewalk or footpath abutting on
               the roadway, shall walk as near as is practicable to the edge of the roadway
                on his or her right-hand side so as to face oncoming traffic on such roadway,
               except where the presence of pedestrians on the roadway is prohibited by a prescribed road traffic sign.</li>
            <li>No pedestrian shall cross a public road without satisfying himself or herself that
               the roadway is sufficiently free from oncoming traffic to permit him or her to cross the road in safety.</li>
            <li>A pedestrian, when crossing a public road by means of a pedestrian crossing or in any other manner,
            shall not linger on such road but shall proceed with due despatch.</li>
            <li>No pedestrian on a public road shall conduct himself or herself in such a manner as to or as is likely to
              constitute a source of danger to himself or herself or to other traffic which is or may be on such road.</li>
            <li>A pedestrian may cross a public road only at a pedestrian crossing or an intersection
               or at a distance further than 50 metres from such pedestrian crossing or intersection.</li>
