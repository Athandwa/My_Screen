            <h2>Traffic lights</h2>
            <img src="images/traffic-light-green.jpg" alt="">
            Green means proceed through the intersection carefully.<br>
            <img src="images/traffic-light-yellow.jpg" alt="">
            Yellow (amber) means stop. You can enter the intersection if you are so close that sudden braking might cause a crash.<br>
            <img src="images/traffic-light-red.jpg" alt="">
            Do not go through the intersection.<br>
            <h3>Turning arrows at traffic lights</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Some traffic lights have arrows to control traffic turning right or left.</li>
              <li>A green arrow means you can only turn in that direction.</li>
              <li>A red arrow means traffic waiting to turn must wait behind the stop
                line until the arrow turns green or disappears, even if there is no traffic on the road.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/turning-arrow-light1.jpg" alt="">
            You must not go straight ahead or turn left. You may turn right.<br>
            <img src="images/turning-arrow-light1.jpg" alt="">
            You must not turn right but you can go straight ahead or turn left if the way is clear.<br>
            <img src="images/turning-arrow-light1.jpg" alt="">
            When the yellow (amber) arrow is flashing, you may proceed but you must give way
            to any pedestrian who is crossing the road into which you are turning.<br>
